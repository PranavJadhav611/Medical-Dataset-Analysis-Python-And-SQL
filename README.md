# Medical Dataset Analysis Python and SQL.
This repository will encompass a comprehensive project involving the analysis of a medical dataset using both Python and SQL programming languages.

## About the Project.
This project centers on three pivotal datasets: "hospitalization_details," "medical_examinations," and "names." Segmented into two integral modules, the project initiates with thorough data cleansing, guaranteeing precision and structural integrity using Python.
Following the meticulous data refinement, the subsequent module harnesses SQL queries using MS SQL server to unearth significant insights from the pristine dataset.

### Tasks in Python
    1) Loading Datasets.
    2) Identifying and handling Null values.
    3) Identifying data types.
    4) Identifying and handling duplicate data.
    5) Data pre-processing and cleaning.
    6) Creating and saving cleaned dataset for further usage

### Tasks in SQL
    1) Creating database.
    2) Loading all the cleaned datasets along with our names.csv dataset
    3) Performing SQL operations to find out answers for multiple questions which could be helpful in 
       identifying pattern in our medical dataset.

### Future usage
The refined dataset and SQL outcomes can be leveraged for advanced visualization through platforms such as Tableau or Power BI.
